								<h3>What do you mean by 'send us a self adressed, stamped envelope to get free stickers'?</h3>
								<p>Simply, put your name, address, and a stamp on any size envelope. Then stick that inside another envelope with our PO Box address and a stamp, and toss it in the mail. Easy!</p>
								<p>(Just a side note, make sure you have enough stamps for the return trip!)</p>
								<h3>I would like to donate to help sustain stick a smile, where can I do so?</h3>
								<p>Donations keep us alive as we need to print more and more stickers on a daily basis and we don't get many orders on our store even though all profits from our store go into further sticker production.

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">So what is stick a smile?</h2>

								<p>In late 2015, I founded stick a smile out of an idea that I could create a happier world through empowering people with a tool to make other people happier with. In my opinion, personal happiness can be found through making other people happier and therefore I saw it as my mission to make a tool that made it as easy as possible for one person to make another person happier.

Smiling is the outmost, simplest expression of human happiness, and by utilising the power of smiling and inciting it within this tool, I could see this idea of empowering someone with a tool to make someone else happier through. <br> <br>

So I designed stickers with quotes reminding people to smile written upon them. These stickers act as a tool to instigate happiness by people giving stickers out anonymously (performing an act of selflessness in which your only goal is to make another person smile) or sticking them in prominent places where people can see (to remind a passing person to have an amazing day and smile, hopefully causing a person to take on that message and smile more!) - all to hopefully make as many people smile as possible. Slowly I built an international community of people dedicated to making people happier through the power of smiling with over 8000 stickers being sent out to over 20 countries, causing thousands of people to smile in the process.

<br>

Join our movement of smiles, and make your world happier today by getting some stickers and stick a smile on someone's face! :)<br> <br>

With peace and love, <br> <br>
